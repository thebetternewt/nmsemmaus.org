<br>
A big “THANK YOU” to Larry Woodward and the Class of 2004 for a job well done in 
service on the North Mississippi Emmaus Community Board of Directors. Last year 
was a tremendous year for North Mississippi Emmaus. Under the leadership of the 
Holy Spirit we celebrated 20 miraculous years of Emmaus and then God opened the 
door for us to extend our boundaries to the country of Honduras.<br>
I appreciate the many hours of service and dedication it took in both of these 
huge projects. “Nothing is impossible with God” and He continues to prove it 
year after year to all who believe and trust Him.<br>
Our partnership with Costa Rica to help start a new Emmaus Community in Honduras 
has begun. In November of 2004, we had the privilege to sponsor 10 Honduran men 
and women to attend a Walk to Emmaus in Costa Rica. Like all Walks, blessings 
were abundant for the pilgrims. This year we have again committed to support 
this effort. Our agape for these pilgrims is to provide their expenses, which 
include airfare, lodging and food. Our contribution for these walks is $5.000.<br>
We need your financial support, your prayers and agape to complete this blessing 
God has made available to us as an Emmaus Community. <br>
Donations to the Honduras Emmaus Project may be mailed to:<br>

We now have available a web page, that we hope will largely replace this 
newsletter.<br>
Our mailing expenses were over $6000 last year, as of April 1, 2005 if you have 
not written me you will not receive a newsletter. In order to use our funds the 
Lord has blessed us with more effectively we are asking that everyone access the 
newsletter electronically. If you cannot do this, write me and I will be glad to 
continue mailing your newsletter.</i></font></p>
