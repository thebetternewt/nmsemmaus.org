<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#FFFF00">The Vision for Emmaus</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4">(the principal points below were taken from an 
article <br>
by Rev. Cherie Jones, in the April-June issue <br>
of the Walk To Emmaus International Newsletter)</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size="4">
The scriptures remind us that, &quot;<i>Where there is no vision, the people perish</i>&quot; 
(Prov. 29: 18 KJV). <br>
A vision of where we want to go gives us a sense of direction as well as 
purpose.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#FFFF00">The vision of the Walk To 
Emmaus is three fold:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5" color="#99FF99">FIRST - WE SEEK TO DEVELOP 
CHRISTIAN LEADERS.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">We invite Christians who are active members of 
local churches to come to the three day weekend. While on their walk, they are 
challenged to take on the disciplines of piety, study, and Christian action for 
the rest of their lives.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5" color="#CCFFFF">SECOND - WE SEEK TO STRENGTHEN 
LOCAL CONGREGATIONS.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">We want pilgrims to return to their local 
churches and continue to offer themselves in service to God through their 
congregations. They take back their understanding of a life marked by piety, 
study, and Christian action. They bring home a renewed energy for loving God and 
neighbor. They bring back a revitalized desire to offer sacrificial love within 
the church.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5" color="#FFCC00">THIRD - WE SEEK TO CHRISTIANIZE 
THE ENVIRONMENT.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">We want the pilgrims to return to their homes, 
places of work, school, neighborhoods, and be faithful witnesses to the grace of 
Jesus Christ. It is our hope and vision that their witness will make a 
difference in their world, that their lives will be marked by honesty and 
integrity, and that the light of Christ will shine through their words and 
deeds.</font></p>
